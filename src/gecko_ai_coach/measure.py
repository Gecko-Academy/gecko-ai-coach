"""The number that says how good the coach is, so "better" is not an opinion.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. Every change to a retriever feels like an
improvement while you are making it. The only way to know is a labelled set and
a number before and afterwards, and the only way to be honest about it is to
report the regression too -- a rule that is easy to write down and unpleasant to
follow, which is exactly why it is the contribution bar for this project.

WHAT IS MEASURED. Hit rate at k: the share of questions whose expected page
appears in the top k retrieved. It measures RETRIEVAL, not prose, on purpose --
retrieval is where the headroom is, it needs no model, and it is the same number
on every machine. Fluency is not measured here because nobody has a cheap
honest way to measure it, and a metric you cannot trust is worse than none.

THE TRAP THIS CANNOT SAVE YOU FROM. Tune on these questions and the number goes
up while the coach gets worse for everyone else. Keep a second set you did not
tune on, report both, and expect the second one to move less.
